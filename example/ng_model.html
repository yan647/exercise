     * @ngdoc directive
     * @name ngModel
     * @restrict A
     * @priority 1
     * @param {expression} ngModel assignable {@link guide/expression Expression} to bind to.
     *
     * @description
     * The `ngModel` directive binds an `input`,`select`, `textarea` (or custom form control) to a
     * property on the scope using {@link ngModel.NgModelController NgModelController},
     * which is created and exposed by this directive.
     *
     * `ngModel` is responsible for:
     *
     * - Binding the view into the model, which other directives such as `input`, `textarea` or `select`
     *   require.
     * - Providing validation behavior (i.e. required, number, email, url).
     * - Keeping the state of the control (valid/invalid, dirty/pristine, touched/untouched, validation errors).
     * - Setting related css classes on the element (`ng-valid`, `ng-invalid`, `ng-dirty`, `ng-pristine`, `ng-touched`,
     *   `ng-untouched`, `ng-empty`, `ng-not-empty`) including animations.
     * - Registering the control with its parent {@link ng.directive:form form}.
     *
     * Note: `ngModel` will try to bind to the property given by evaluating the expression on the
     * current scope. If the property doesn't already exist on this scope, it will be created
     * implicitly and added to the scope.
     *
     * For best practices on using `ngModel`, see:
     *
     *  - [Understanding Scopes](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes)
     *
     * For basic examples, how to use `ngModel`, see:
     *
     *  - {@link ng.directive:input input}
     *    - {@link input[text] text}
     *    - {@link input[checkbox] checkbox}
     *    - {@link input[radio] radio}
     *    - {@link input[number] number}
     *    - {@link input[email] email}
     *    - {@link input[url] url}
     *    - {@link input[date] date}
     *    - {@link input[datetime-local] datetime-local}
     *    - {@link input[time] time}
     *    - {@link input[month] month}
     *    - {@link input[week] week}
     *  - {@link ng.directive:select select}
     *  - {@link ng.directive:textarea textarea}
     *
     * ## Complex Models (objects or collections)
     *
     * By default, `ngModel` watches the model by reference, not value. This is important to know when
     * binding inputs to models that are objects (e.g. `Date`) or collections (e.g. arrays). If only properties of the
     * object or collection change, `ngModel` will not be notified and so the input will not be  re-rendered.
     *
     * The model must be assigned an entirely new object or collection before a re-rendering will occur.
     *
     * Some directives have options that will cause them to use a custom `$watchCollection` on the model expression
     * - for example, `ngOptions` will do so when a `track by` clause is included in the comprehension expression or
     * if the select is given the `multiple` attribute.
     *
     * The `$watchCollection()` method only does a shallow comparison, meaning that changing properties deeper than the
     * first level of the object (or only changing the properties of an item in the collection if it's an array) will still
     * not trigger a re-rendering of the model.
     *
     * ## CSS classes
     * The following CSS classes are added and removed on the associated input/select/textarea element
     * depending on the validity of the model.
     *
     *  - `ng-valid`: the model is valid
     *  - `ng-invalid`: the model is invalid
     *  - `ng-valid-[key]`: for each valid key added by `$setValidity`
     *  - `ng-invalid-[key]`: for each invalid key added by `$setValidity`
     *  - `ng-pristine`: the control hasn't been interacted with yet
     *  - `ng-dirty`: the control has been interacted with
     *  - `ng-touched`: the control has been blurred
     *  - `ng-untouched`: the control hasn't been blurred
     *  - `ng-pending`: any `$asyncValidators` are unfulfilled
     *  - `ng-empty`: the view does not contain a value or the value is deemed "empty", as defined
     *     by the {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$isEmpty} method
     *  - `ng-not-empty`: the view contains a non-empty value
     *
     * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
     *
     * @animations
     * Animations within models are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed
     * on the input element which is attached to the model. These classes include: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`,
     * `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any other validations that are performed on the model itself.
     * The animations that are triggered within ngModel are similar to how they work in ngClass and
     * animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well as JS animations.
     *
     * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style an input element
     * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
     *
     * <pre>
     * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
     * //advanced animations
     * .my-input {
     *   transition:0.5s linear all;
     *   background: white;
     * }
     * .my-input.ng-invalid {
     *   background: red;
     *   color:white;
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @example
     * ### Basic Usage
     * <example deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true" module="inputExample" name="ng-model">
     <file name="index.html">
     <script>
     angular.module('inputExample', [])
     .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
            $scope.val = '1';
          }]);
</script>
<style>
    .my-input {
        transition:all linear 0.5s;
        background: transparent;
    }
    .my-input.ng-invalid {
        color:white;
        background: red;
    }
</style>
<p id="inputDescription">
    Update input to see transitions when valid/invalid.
    Integer is a valid value.
</p>
<form name="testForm" ng-controller="ExampleController">
    <input ng-model="val" ng-pattern="/^\d+$/" name="anim" class="my-input"
           aria-describedby="inputDescription" />
</form>
</file>
* </example>

* @example
* ### Binding to a getter/setter
*
* Sometimes it's helpful to bind `ngModel` to a getter/setter function.  A getter/setter is a
* function that returns a representation of the model when called with zero arguments, and sets
* the internal state of a model when called with an argument. It's sometimes useful to use this
* for models that have an internal representation that's different from what the model exposes
* to the view.
*
* <div class="alert alert-success">
    * **Best Practice:** It's best to keep getters fast because AngularJS is likely to call them more
    * frequently than other parts of your code.
    * </div>
*
* You use this behavior by adding `ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }"` to an element that
* has `ng-model` attached to it. You can also add `ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }"` to
* a `<form>`, which will enable this behavior for all `<input>`s within it. See
    * {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions`} for more.
    *
    * The following example shows how to use `ngModel` with a getter/setter:
    *
    * @example
    * <example name="ngModel-getter-setter" module="getterSetterExample">
        <file name="index.html">
            <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
                <form name="userForm">
                    <label>Name:
                        <input type="text" name="userName"
                               ng-model="user.name"
                               ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }" />
                    </label>
                </form>
                <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind="user.name()"></span></pre>
            </div>
        </file>
        <file name="app.js">
            angular.module('getterSetterExample', [])
            .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
            var _name = 'Brian';
            $scope.user = {
            name: function(newName) {
            // Note that newName can be undefined for two reasons:
            // 1. Because it is called as a getter and thus called with no arguments
            // 2. Because the property should actually be set to undefined. This happens e.g. if the
            //    input is invalid
            return arguments.length ? (_name = newName) : _name;
            }
            };
            }]);
        </file>
        * </example>
